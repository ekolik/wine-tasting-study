# Wine Value Analysis and Blind Tasting Modeling

It's recommended to read the notebooks in the following order:
1. *data_exploration.ipynb* - Here we explore the data and prepare it for further analyses. The data used in this project is taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zynicide/wine-reviews) and contains around 130k wine reviews. Note that this repo doesn't include the data itself, so access it on Kaggle if you need it.
2. *wine_value_analysis.ipynb* - Here we find **value wines** and their main characteristics. In particular, we explore which countries, regions and grape varieties we should pay attention to in our search for value wines.
3. *blind_tasting_red_wine.ipynb* - Here we build a model that **predicts a red wine's grape variety** based on the tasting description - this is what sommeliers call "blind tasting". Besides making the prediction, we display the main descriptors, or key words, characteristic of the variety.
